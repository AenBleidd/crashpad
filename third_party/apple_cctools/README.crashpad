Description:
cctools contains portions of Appleâ€™s compiler toolchain, including common tools
like ar, as, nm, strings, and strip, and platform-specific tools like lipo and
otool. It also contains support libraries such as libmacho, which contains
interfaces for dealing with Mach-O images.

libmacho is available on Mac OS X as a runtime library that is part of
libSystem, but versions of libmacho included in operating system versions prior
to Mac OS X 10.7 did not include the getsectiondata() and getsegmentdata()
functions. This library is present here to provide implementations of these
functions for systems that do not have them.

Local Modifications:
 - Only cctools/APPLE_LICENSE, cctools/libmacho/getsecbyname.c, and
   cctools/include/mach-o/getsect.h are included.
